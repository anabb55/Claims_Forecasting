No missing values were found across any column. This is expected because the dataset appears to be curated and insurance attributes are typically mandatory.

Claim counts are highly zero-inflated (median = 0, mean ≈ 0.05), with a long right tail (max = 16 claims).

Exposure is concentrated around 1–2 years, confirming yearly contracts and renewals. Very small exposure values (< 0.05) exist and lead to artificially high claim frequencies.

Density and BonusMalus show the strongest tail behavior, which is natural: large cities and high-risk drivers create heavy right tails.

Outliers are present but meaningful and should not be removed; insurance risk data is naturally skewed and heavy-tailed.

a small number of risky policies cause many claims

a large number of safe policies cause none

Do not remove very high values for ClaimNb because it is really meaningful and that's what insurance companies are looking for.

very low exposures -> Exposure = 0.03 years

ClaimNb = 1

That implies they had a claim very quickly after the policy started → a high-risk profile.
